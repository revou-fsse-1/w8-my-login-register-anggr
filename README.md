## Overview

### The Challenge

This is a list of requirements for a web development assignment that involves creating a login and registration page with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features:

- Specific rules for form inputs, including Email input type must be "email" and must be validated. Password input type must be "text" and must be validated with minimum criteria: 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 number.
- The homepage should have CRUD features.
- An example account is provided for the website: email "admin@gmail.com" and password "Admin123".

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- Event-driven programming: The use of the _addEventListener_ method to register an event handler function for the _DOMContentLoaded_ event allows the script to run as soon as the document has finished loading.
- Manipulating the DOM: The script uses the _innerHTML_ property to dynamically generate and update the HTML content of the crewTable element based on the data stored in localStorage.
- Validating user input: The script validates user input to ensure that it is in the correct format and range, preventing errors and unexpected behavior.

### Continued development

- I'd like to improve the security of the website.
- A better user interface.
- Better error handling.
- Using database instead of local storage.
